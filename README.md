# film-tracker
Mobile app for keeping track of your vintage cameras and what film they're loaded with

# Description
One of the challenges of collecting vintage cameras is remembering what film you have loaded in each camera.  Many cameras have indicators to help you remember, but they donâ€™t always map to modern films.  This tool is for keeping track of your rolls of film, from loading all the way through developing.
